Independently review the supplied Sprint 5 execution candidate at exact git revision ba3661f3e875ef6c48e71300fec339d333dab697. You are a native external reviewer, not the implementer. Analyze source correctness, OpenSpec compliance within this scope, proof strength/premises, missing checks, false evidence claims, and discriminating tests. Report ACCEPT WITH LIMITATIONS or REQUEST CHANGES, with ranked concrete file/line findings, exploit/counterexample where possible, and limits. Do not claim independent execution: tools are disabled and source is supplied. Full financial workflows/mutation evidence are still under implementation and will have a separate review; assess these core declarations and their stated claims now. Do not assume unchecked assumptions are proofs. No Foreman. Return concise actionable findings, preserving dissent.

## Context

See [proposal.md](proposal.md) for motivation and scope. Sprint 4 supplies a
registered, typed, single-transition executor and capability administration.
Its successful-execution theorems expose evaluated effects, scoped authority,
accounting, nonnegativity, and locality. It has no component catalog or sequence
semantics. The historical `Defialgebra.Interface` and `Nary` results remain intact;
their structural port laws do not establish operational workflow laws.

The implementation is additive under `DefiKernel.Composition`. Lean remains the
proof authority. This design describes work to implement; it reports no new
proofs, runtime results, or independent review acceptance.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:** Make finite ordered workflows executable and observable, with checked
component boundaries and explicit theorem premises. Reuse the trusted Sprint 4
executor and lift its actual guarantees by induction over committed steps.

**Non-Goals:** See proposal exclusions. In particular, ledger framing does not
prove confidentiality, capability provenance, solvency, or arbitrary semantic
contracts. Value routing is limited to literals and previous output snapshots.

## Decisions

### 1. Separate immutable configuration, mutable world, and trusted boundary

`World` contains the existing typed ledger and capability store. Immutable
configuration contains a component catalog, one operation registry, and domain
administrators; derive issuance configuration from that same registry.

The trusted adapter supplies authenticated invocation context, observations,
and time separately from caller-controlled steps. Index these boundary inputs
by absolute step position. Requests cannot replace the registry, operation body,
guard, principal, or domain. Invocation steps identify a component, registered
operation, parties, argument bindings, and capability IDs; administrative steps
request issuance or revocation through the existing authority API.

This avoids duplicating the authority model or accepting authentication facts
from workflow data. Administration changes only the store. Ordinary invocation
changes only the ledger. Both consume the immediately preceding world.

### 2. Stable ports and explicit resource visibility

Use stable `(ComponentId, PortId)` names, with duplicate identities rejected.
Keep value ports separate from resource ports:

- Input value ports declare existing `Typed.Unit` types and map to the registered
  operation's ordered argument signature.
- Output value ports select ledger cells visible to the component and return
  typed post-state balance snapshots. They are total after successful execution.
- Resource ports identify exact cells, including domain and asset, with read or
  read/write access. Shared imports must match declared exports and cannot
  escalate access.

Each component owns a finite private cell set and an operation allowlist.
Private ownership is disjoint and excludes every other component's resource
access. Operations have unambiguous component ownership. Resolve operation cell
references using the actual context/parties/arguments; conservatively check all
required and declared reads and writes against permitted component access before
calling the executor. Include guards, both expression branches, supply-related
reads, and output selections. Existing domain and capability checks still apply.
A valid debit grant does not override interface isolation. Read access does not
imply write access. Passing a numeric value grants no resource access.

An untyped port dictionary would move unit errors into financial execution.
Arbitrary output expressions would introduce a second evaluator and possible
post-commit failures. Selected-cell snapshots provide sufficient first-sprint
composition without those costs.

### 3. Structural validation and proof-level contracts have separate roles

Validate finite structural configuration before execution: identities, ownership,
port links, operation membership/signatures, and resource access declarations.
Invalid configuration returns a configuration refusal with the initial world,
no events, and no outputs.

Define `ComponentContract` using Lean predicates for initialization, boundary
assumptions, invariants, and guarantees. Define global `Initial cfg world` and
local preservation obligations. The executable runner may start from any typed
world; it does not decide arbitrary propositions. Reachability and contract
theorems require an explicit initialization witness and proofs of the relevant
local obligations and external assumptions. Concrete examples supply witnesses.
Contracts are not caller callbacks or accepted certificate labels.

This keeps externally assumed observation truth and authentic configuration
visible. Automatic assume-guarantee discharge is a later sprint.

### 4. Execute the successful prefix and stop at the first refusal

Execute steps in list order. Successful steps commit their world and receipt.
The first refused step leaves its input world unchanged and terminates the run;
no output or successful receipt is produced for that step or the suffix. The
empty list is identity. There is no rollback, retry, or skip.

Input bindings are a closed datatype: literal packed value or earlier absolute
step index plus qualified output port. Only an earlier successful invocation can
provide an output. Resolve bindings and check units before financial execution;
reject unknown, forward, missing, or incompatible bindings. Configuration errors
precede steps; within a step, validate membership/bindings/interface access before
delegating to the kernel. Once delegated, preserve its existing refusal order and
reason, wrapping kernel and administrative failures without reclassification.

Return final world, successful events, typed output history, and an optional
failure containing absolute index, step identity, and reason. Preserve these
fields across continuation. The append/resume theorem includes output history,
absolute boundary position, and the terminal-failure flag: resuming a failed
prefix executes nothing. This proves a finite-list law, not general behavioral
associativity of networks.

Atomic rollback would discard the successful prefix and belongs to the separate
atomic composition operator on the roadmap.

### 5. Receipts must correspond to actual evaluated effects

Wrap existing `Typed.execute`; do not implement another financial executor.
For accepted invocations, extract the evaluated template/effects using the same
registry, arguments, pre-state, context, observations, and time. An executable
second evaluation is acceptable for these bounded references. Prove extraction
cannot fail after genuine executor success, using `execute_ok_iff` and
`execute_evaluated`. Any internal extraction inconsistency must stop without
committing; never insert defaults or fabricate a receipt.

The receipt records actual evaluated deltas, supply changes, and checked writes,
plus selected post-state output snapshots. Supply is not defined as observed
post-minus-pre balance; that would make accounting tautological. Administrative
receipts record the corresponding store transition and zero ledger effects.

`StepSound` relates each receipt to its actual pre-world and existing executor or
administrative API. `TraceSound` chains those relations. Prove runner soundness
and delegated acceptance/refusal correspondence, including receipt extraction.

### 6. Lift only justified properties, with explicit support for framing

Induct over the successful event prefix, including runs ending in refusal:

- Accounting: each domain/asset's final total equals its initial total plus the
  sum of actual successful invocation supply receipts. Administration and refusal
  contribute zero.
- Nonnegativity: every reachable ledger has nonnegative balances.
- Authority: each successful invocation, debit, and supply change has the existing
  witness in that step's pre-store. A later revocation need not leave it live in
  the final store. Administrative steps satisfy their own authorization relation.
- Locality: cells outside the union of successful checked writes are unchanged;
  refused steps contribute no writes. Domain restrictions remain per operation.
- Initialization: a proved initial predicate and local invariant-preservation
  premises imply the invariant at every reachable prefix.

Define `AgreeOn protected s t` and `Supports protected predicate`: agreement on
those ledger cells implies equivalent predicate truth. Disjointness between the
protected set and the successful write union yields a ledger frame theorem, then
the supported-predicate theorem. Arbitrary predicates and capability-dependent
predicates are excluded from this ledger-only frame theorem. Capability changes
are instead covered by exact step/store propagation statements.

### 7. Add narrow modules and evidence without rewriting historical semantics

| Planned path | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `lean/DefiKernel/Composition/Interfaces.lean` | Catalog, ports, ownership, access and binding validation |
| `lean/DefiKernel/Composition/Contracts.lean` | Initial predicates, assumptions, guarantees and support |
| `lean/DefiKernel/Composition/Execution.lean` | World, trusted boundary, steps, receipts and step correspondence |
| `lean/DefiKernel/Composition/Sequence.lean` | Ordered runner, observations, histories and trace soundness |
| `lean/DefiKernel/Composition/Preservation.lean` | Inductive preservation, append/resume and frame theorems |
| `lean/DefiKernel/Composition/Examples.lean` | Composed reference configurations and initialization witnesses |
| `lean/DefiKernel/Composition/Tests.lean` | Named comparisons and executable success/refusal checks |
| `lean/DefiKernel/Composition/Audit.lean`, `Verify.lean` | Imported axiom coverage and verification drivers |
| `scripts/check_composition_mutations.py` | Actual source mutations and machine-readable evidence |
| `scripts/test_composition_mutation_runner.py` | Real CLI positive and negative controls |
| `review/semantic-kernel/sprint5/` | Source-bound build, runtime, proof, mutation and native-review evidence |

Add the composition import to `lean/DefiKernel.lean`. Keep executable definitions
and runtime fixtures available to mutation projection, with proofs and drivers
separated consistently with the existing audit approach. The typed mutation
runner is namespace-specific; add a scoped composition runner rather than
assuming it accepts a different namespace. Preserve its historical controls.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- Component boundaries can be weaker than capability checks if only IDs are
  checked → resolve concrete reads/writes and test foreign-private interference
  with an otherwise valid capability and funded balance.
- Trace theorems can accidentally describe fresh execution from the initial
  state → require pre-world adjacency and mutants that reset ledger or store.
- Receipts can restate the intended conclusion → extract genuine evaluated
  supplies and prove correspondence before proving cumulative accounting.
- Proof-level assumptions can look executable → distinguish structural rejection
  from theorem premises in APIs, examples, and reports.
- Snapshot outputs and repeated evaluation cost extra work → accept this bounded
  reference cost; performance and a one-pass refinement are later optimizations.
- Successful footprint guarantees do not imply absence of observations during
  refusal → make no general confidentiality or full noninterference claim.
- Exact rational reference behavior can be mistaken for deployed behavior → keep
  machine arithmetic and implementation refinement explicitly deferred.

## Migration Plan

Implement in the order in [tasks.md](tasks.md): baseline, interfaces/contracts,
step adapter, sequence runner, proofs, reference checks, adversarial evidence,
then independent review and delivery. Keep original proof and corpus files intact.
Run the full existing build and regression drivers alongside the new drivers.
Bind review to an exact candidate commit; fixes invalidate affected review and
verification evidence. GPT-6 implements using the stock harness; native Grok and
Fable review the results. Do not use Foreman.

Rollback consists of reverting additive composition changes and the new root
import; no data migration or change to Sprint 4 execution is required. This
OpenSpec package remains a plan until its implementation tasks and evidence are
completed. Archive it only after actual implementation and verification.

## Purpose

Describe component boundaries and typed connections so workflows can exchange
values and share resources without silently expanding access or proof claims.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Stable typed port declarations
The system SHALL identify ports by stable component and port identities, distinguish
value inputs, value outputs, and resource access, and reject duplicate identities,
unknown operations, ambiguous operation ownership, and incompatible signatures.

#### Scenario: Valid declared operation
- **WHEN** a uniquely owned registered operation has inputs matching its signature and valid selected-cell outputs
- **THEN** its interface is accepted and every output has the selected cell's asset unit

#### Scenario: Invalid declarations
- **WHEN** declarations contain duplicate port identities, an unknown operation, ambiguous ownership, or a signature mismatch
- **THEN** configuration validation refuses before any workflow step executes

### Requirement: Private ownership and explicit shared access
The system SHALL enforce disjoint private ownership and explicitly matched shared
resource imports and exports, including exact cell identity, domain, asset, and
access rights. Private cells SHALL NOT be accessible as another component's
resources. A component SHALL access only its permitted reads and writes.

#### Scenario: Overlapping ownership
- **WHEN** two components claim the same private cell or another component imports that cell as shared
- **THEN** configuration validation refuses without changing the world

#### Scenario: Authorized shared use
- **WHEN** a component accesses an explicitly exported and matching shared resource within its granted access and kernel authority
- **THEN** the interface boundary permits the operation

#### Scenario: Read-only import
- **WHEN** a component attempts to write a resource imported for reading only
- **THEN** interface validation refuses the step even if a debit capability is otherwise valid

#### Scenario: Funded foreign-private interference
- **WHEN** an operation targets another component's funded private cell with an otherwise valid live debit capability
- **THEN** the interface boundary refuses without changing the world

#### Scenario: Undeclared reads
- **WHEN** a guard, effect, supply expression, output selection, or unselected expression branch references a cell outside permitted read access
- **THEN** the interface boundary rejects the declaration or refuses the step before delegated financial execution

### Requirement: Typed values do not transfer resource rights
The system SHALL route literal values and outputs of earlier successful steps only
when their units match the receiving inputs. Value transfer SHALL NOT create
resource aliases, authorize writes, or move balances by itself.

#### Scenario: Valid snapshot binding
- **WHEN** a USD output from an earlier successful step is bound to a USD input
- **THEN** the receiving operation uses that recorded value and still requires its own resource and capability permissions

#### Scenario: Wrong unit or unavailable output
- **WHEN** a binding has the wrong unit or names an unknown, forward, or unavailable output
- **THEN** the step refuses before financial execution and produces no output

### Requirement: Explicit semantic contract premises
The system SHALL represent initialization, assumptions, invariants, and guarantees
as explicit proof obligations. Arbitrary semantic predicates SHALL NOT be treated
as automatically checked by structural validation or as proved by declaration.

#### Scenario: Initialized invariant reasoning
- **WHEN** an initial-state witness, required boundary assumptions, and local invariant-preservation proofs are supplied
- **THEN** the corresponding workflow invariant theorem is available with those premises recorded

#### Scenario: Missing external assumption
- **WHEN** a declared guarantee relies on observation truth without a proof or supplied premise
- **THEN** the guarantee remains conditional and is not reported as unconditionally verified


## FILE openspec/changes/typed-interfaces-sequential-composition/specs/sequential-workflow-execution/spec.md sha256=df7daac2ac265847b0183eb9ab3cecbd4030ff7ce8756f9e40af5db3a71e287e

## Purpose

Specify observable ordered execution with explicit state, capability changes,
output histories, and preservation of the successful prefix on refusal.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Validated initialization and trusted execution inputs
The system SHALL validate structural configuration before execution and receive
authenticated context, observations, and time separately from workflow requests.
Boundary inputs SHALL be indexed by absolute step position. Malformed
configuration SHALL return the unchanged initial world with no executed events.

#### Scenario: Invalid initial configuration
- **WHEN** a workflow is submitted with invalid component ownership or bindings in its configuration
- **THEN** execution returns a configuration refusal and no step runs

#### Scenario: Caller cannot replace authority context
- **WHEN** a request claims an actor different from the adapter's authenticated principal
- **THEN** the existing actor-consistency refusal is preserved for an otherwise well-formed invocation

### Requirement: Current-world propagation
The system SHALL execute each step against the immediately preceding ledger and
capability store. Invocation success SHALL preserve the store, administrative
success SHALL preserve the ledger, and every refusal SHALL preserve its input world.

#### Scenario: Consecutive funded transfers
- **WHEN** Alice starts with 10 USD and two authorized transfers of 3 USD to Bob execute
- **THEN** Alice ends with 4 USD and Bob gains 6 USD

#### Scenario: Issue use revoke use
- **WHEN** a capability is validly issued, used successfully, revoked, and then requested again
- **THEN** the first use remains committed and the second use refuses under the updated store

### Requirement: Ordered first-refusal execution
The system SHALL execute in submitted order, stop at the first refusal, retain all
earlier successful changes, and execute no suffix. Empty execution SHALL be identity.

#### Scenario: Empty workflow
- **WHEN** an empty workflow runs from a valid configuration
- **THEN** it succeeds with the unchanged world and empty event and output histories

#### Scenario: First step refusal
- **WHEN** the first step refuses
- **THEN** the initial world is returned with failure index zero and no successful events or outputs

#### Scenario: Middle refusal preserves prefix
- **WHEN** a successful transfer is followed by an insufficient-funds deposit and a funded later action
- **THEN** only the transfer remains committed and the funded suffix action does not execute

#### Scenario: Ordering changes observations
- **WHEN** transfer-then-deposit and deposit-then-transfer encounter different intermediate balances
- **THEN** each run reports its own ordered successful prefix, resulting world, and first refusal

### Requirement: Observable receipts and refusal provenance
The system SHALL expose successful step identities, actual evaluated ledger effects
and supply changes, administrative store changes, selected post-state outputs,
and final world. A failure SHALL include its absolute position, step identity, and
reason. Failed steps SHALL produce no successful receipt or output.

#### Scenario: Delegated refusal
- **WHEN** an interface-valid and correctly bound step is refused by the financial executor or capability administrator
- **THEN** its original refusal reason is retained with the workflow position

#### Scenario: Snapshot remains historical
- **WHEN** a later step changes a cell previously emitted as an output
- **THEN** the earlier output remains its original post-step snapshot

### Requirement: Continuation preserves history and boundary position
The system SHALL make execution of an appended list agree with continuation from
its prefix, carrying the world, outputs, next absolute index, and terminal status.

#### Scenario: Successful prefix resumed
- **WHEN** a suffix consumes a prefix output and a position-dependent trusted input
- **THEN** resumed execution equals one-pass execution in final world, events, outputs, and failure

#### Scenario: Failed prefix resumed
- **WHEN** a suffix is appended to a prefix that has already refused
- **THEN** continuation returns the failed prefix unchanged and executes no additional steps


## FILE openspec/changes/typed-interfaces-sequential-composition/specs/sequential-preservation/spec.md sha256=793d51a056fa74eed3cebb244cdb6052064b00e72ae4eee5c6854fcfa8bc7c93

## Purpose

State the proof obligations needed to lift trusted transition properties to
finite workflows without hiding initialization, authority, or frame premises.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Step and trace correspondence
The system SHALL prove that every successful event corresponds to the existing
registered executor or administrative operation at its immediately preceding
world and that accepted invocation receipts contain the actual evaluated effects.
It SHALL prove receipt extraction succeeds whenever delegated execution succeeds.

#### Scenario: Accepted invocation receipt
- **WHEN** an invocation appears in a successful trace prefix
- **THEN** a proof connects its pre-world, evaluated effects, output snapshots, and post-world to the registered execution

#### Scenario: Refused suffix
- **WHEN** a trace ends in refusal
- **THEN** its final world equals the world after exactly its successful prefix

### Requirement: Cumulative accounting and nonnegativity
The system SHALL prove that every final domain/asset total equals its initial total
plus the sum of actual successful invocation supply changes and that every
reachable balance remains nonnegative. Administration and refusal SHALL contribute
zero ledger change.

#### Scenario: Mint then burn
- **WHEN** a valid deposit and withdrawal mint and burn shares within a workflow
- **THEN** cumulative accounting sums both evaluated supplies and applies separately to every domain and asset

#### Scenario: Accounting at refusal
- **WHEN** one supply-changing step succeeds and a later step refuses
- **THEN** accounting includes the successful supply change and excludes the refused step and suffix

### Requirement: Authority at the point of use
The system SHALL prove invocation, debit, and supply authority using each
successful step's pre-store and administrative authorization using the existing
administrative relation. It SHALL NOT require earlier grants to remain live in
the final store.

#### Scenario: Successful use followed by revocation
- **WHEN** a successful authorized operation is followed by valid revocation
- **THEN** the operation's authority witness is proved at its execution point even though the grant is no longer live afterward

### Requirement: Initialized invariant preservation
The system SHALL prove invariant preservation at every reachable prefix from an
explicit initialization proof and applicable local preservation and boundary
assumptions. Missing premises SHALL remain visible in the statement.

#### Scenario: Inductive guarantee
- **WHEN** initialization establishes an invariant and each admitted step preserves it under stated assumptions
- **THEN** the invariant holds at every successful prefix and at the final world of a refused run

### Requirement: Write locality and supported-predicate framing
The system SHALL prove unchanged ledger cells outside the union of successful
checked writes. It SHALL prove preservation of a predicate only given a proof that
the predicate depends solely on protected ledger cells disjoint from that union.
This frame guarantee SHALL be restricted to ledger predicates.

#### Scenario: Protected ledger predicate
- **WHEN** a predicate is supported on protected cells untouched by all successful steps
- **THEN** its truth is equivalent before and after the workflow, including a workflow ending in refusal

#### Scenario: Unsupported predicate counterexample
- **WHEN** a proposed predicate depends on a balance modified by a successful transfer
- **THEN** a concrete counterexample demonstrates why the frame theorem cannot omit its support and disjointness premises

### Requirement: Scoped sequential composition law
The system SHALL prove the finite-list append/continuation law with preserved
history and absolute boundary positions, including failure short-circuiting.
It SHALL describe this result without claiming general network associativity.

#### Scenario: Boundary-sensitive composition
- **WHEN** a suffix uses time or principal inputs dependent on its absolute position
- **THEN** the append theorem compares execution with the same positions and does not reset them at the suffix

# Sprint 5 execution adapter report

Scope: tasks 3.1–3.5, implemented by the GPT-6 stock harness worker. No commit was created by this worker. Parent owns integration and independent native review.

`Execution.lean` defines immutable configuration, separately supplied boundary context/environment/time, caller invocation data, administrative steps, actual evaluated receipts, and `executeStep`. Configuration and interface preparation precede delegated financial execution. Issuance configuration is derived from exactly the execution registry. Financial execution receives the current pre-world ledger and capability store.

The adapter re-evaluates the selected registered template and checked arguments against the same pre-world. `extractReceipt_total` derives total extraction from `Typed.execute_evaluated`; `extractReceipt_correspondence` links the extracted evaluation to actual application. No synthetic/default receipt or post-minus-pre supply definition is used. Error outcomes contain no committed world or successful outputs; the sequence layer retains the pre-world on error.

`StepSound` relates each successful invocation to preparation, registered execution, actual extraction/application, and exact selected post-state snapshots. Administrative constructors retain the exact issue/revoke API equations. `executeStep_sound` proves this relation for adapter successes. Generic delegated success/refusal theorems preserve delegated refusal reasons and show accepted financial calls cannot fail receipt extraction.

Step lemmas prove actual receipt accounting, checked-write locality, invocation capability preservation, administrative ledger preservation, administrator identity, effect debit/supply and invocation authority at the pre-store, and per-invocation changed-cell domain restriction. Nonnegative balances are intrinsic to the resulting `Typed.State`; existing kernel success establishes them when constructing the state.

Verification: `lake build DefiKernel.Composition.ExecutionTests` passed with 926 jobs and 11/11 named executable comparisons. Checks exercise exact transfer movement/evaluated writes/supply/snapshot; actor mismatch before missing invoke authority; kernel authority, membership, input-unit and configuration refusals; issue/revoke ledger and receipt behavior; administrative unauthorized/unknown-capability refusals. These are bounded runtime comparisons, not general theorems. Existing Typed.Transition linter warnings are unchanged. New line-width warnings were subsequently removed and a focused Lean compile was run.

The integrated runner, full imported axiom audit, source mutations, exact candidate commit and Grok/Fable review remain parent integration responsibilities. ReceiptAuthorized has True administrative branches because administrative authorization is separately stated by StepSound.issue_admin/revoke_admin; it does not assert grants for administration. Trust assumptions remain registry/admin/boundary authenticity and observation truth.
